abstract = {We have searched for proton decay via p -{\textgreater} e+ pi0 using data from a 25.5 kton-year exposure of the Super-Kamiokande detector. We find no candidate events with an expected background induced by atmospheric neutrinos of 0.1 events. From these data, we set a lower limit on the partial lifetime of the proton to be 1.6E33 years at a 90{\%} confidence level.},

@article{Bueno2007,
abstract = {Grand Unification of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions into a single unified gauge group is an extremely appealing idea which has been vigorously pursued theoretically and experimentally for many years. The detection of proton or bound-neutron decays would represent its most direct experimental evidence. In this context, we studied the physics potentialities of very large underground Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr TPC). We carried out a detailed simulation of signal efficiency and background sources, including atmospheric neutrinos and cosmogenic backgrounds. We point out that a liquid Argon TPC, offering good granularity and energy resolution, low particle detection threshold, and excellent background discrimination, should yield very good signal over background ratios in many possible decay modes, allowing to reach partial lifetime sensitivities in the range of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}34{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}35{\}}{\$} years with exposures up to 1000 kton{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}year, often in quasi-background-free conditions optimal for discoveries at the few events level, corresponding to atmospheric neutrino background rejections of the order of {\$}10{\^{}}5{\$}. Multi-prong decay modes like e.g. {\$}p\backslashto \backslashmu{\^{}}- \backslashpi{\^{}}+ K{\^{}}+{\$} or {\$}p\backslashto e{\^{}}+\backslashpi{\^{}}+\backslashpi{\^{}}-{\$} and channels involving kaons like e.g. {\$}p\backslashto K{\^{}}+\backslashbar\backslashnu{\$}, {\$}p\backslashto e{\^{}}+K{\^{}}0{\$} and {\$}p\backslashto \backslashmu{\^{}}+K{\^{}}0{\$} are particularly suitable, since liquid Argon imaging (...)},
