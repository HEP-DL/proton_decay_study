Installation
============

As far as pre-requistes go, the big one is Tensorflow. We require `Tensorflow>=1.0.0`, but this is not strictly enforced due to some issues on certain machines.

The easiest way to install this package is by using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install git+https://github.com/HEP-DL/proton_decay_study

If there is an existing installation, you can provide an upgrade flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install git+https://github.com/HEP-DL/proton_decay_study
